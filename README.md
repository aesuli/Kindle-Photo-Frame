# Kindle Photoframe

I have implemented a Photoframe function for my Kindle 4 (also known as the no touch version):
* Shows a random picture from those stored in a directory on the Kindle.
* Changes the picture at a given time interval, without manual intervention.
* Works with jpeg and png images, no image preprocessing required.

One goal was the maximization of the battery life:
* No active wifi connection is required. 
* Kindle wakes up automatically only to change the picture it shows, otherwise it stays in deep sleep.

## Installation

### Jailbreak

Running a photoframe software on the the Kindle required to jailbreak it (please read the [DISCLAIMER](#DISCLAIMER) again) and ssh access. I followed [the steps reported here](https://gist.github.com/estysdesu/c90478aac75b732820be6720254aeda7), which are mainly based on [this wiki page](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle4NTHacking). The part on recovering the root password using [this website](https://www.sven.de/kindle/) was a key information the get ssh/scp access to the device.

### FBInk

The key element of the photoframe is [NiLuJe's FBInk tool](https://github.com/NiLuJe/FBInk), which is able to show almost any image on the eink display. Great work!

I [downloaded the FBInk binaries for Kindle here](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=299620). 
Using scp I created a `fbink` subdirectory in the `/mnt/us/` directory on the Kindle.
I copied the content of the zip file in that `fbink` directory.
From a ssh console I created a symlink to the executables in the `/usr/local/bin` directory:

```
cd /usr/local/bin
mntroot rw
ln -s /mnt/us/fbink/K3/bin/fbink fbink
ln -s /mnt/us/fbink/K3/bin/fbdepth fbdepth
mntroot ro
```

### Photoframe scripts

The photoframe application is just a bunch of shell scripts that:
* listens for the "going to sleep" event
* selects a random picture from the `picture` folder
* shows it using FBInk
* sets a RTC wakeup using for a given time interval

Whenever the Kindle wakes up, the script checks if it is caused by the RTC or not:
* if so, it triggers a picture update following the steps listed before
* if not, it means that the wakeup come from a human action and no action is taken

I copied the [`photoframe`](photoframe) directory of this repository in the `/mnt/us` directory of the Kindle.

### Picture folder

I created a `picture` folder in the `/mnt/us/documents` directory:

```
cd /mnt/us/documents
mkdir pictures
```

The pictures to be shown by Photoframe must be put here.

FBInk is able to show most of jpeg and png images. 
No preprocessing is required, yet I scale down large images to have a longer side of 800 pixel, to reduce the time required to load the image.

Note that the path `/mnt/us/documents` corresponds to the root directory of the Kindle drive shown when connecting it to the computer. 
I load and delete pictures using the USB connection.

Any change made to the content of the `picture` directory is effective at the next picture update, as the script checks the content of the directory every time it changes the picture.

### Update frequency

The time interval of update is stored it in the [`photoframe/delta.txt`](photoframe/delta.txt) file.
It is a plain text file with the value is expressed in seconds.

### Logging

I defined a minimal logging, that is enabled by deleting the [`photoframe/NO_LOGGING`](photoframe/NO_LOGGING) file.
Relevant events are logged in [`photoframe/photoframe.log`](photoframe/photoframe.log).
I create an empty `photoframe/NO_LOGGING` file to disable logging.

### Running

From a ssh console, I start the `photoframe.sh` script in background:

```
cd /mnt/us/photoframe
./photoframe.sh &
exit
```

Now whenever the Kindle goes to sleep it shows a random picture from the ones in the `picture` directory, and it changes them with the frequency stated in the `delta.txt` file.

### Autostart

To have photoframe.sh to automatically running every time the Kindle boots, the script `/etc/init.d/boot_finished` must be modified:
```
cd /etc/init.d
mntroot rw
nano /etc/init.d/boot_finished
mntroot ro
```

modify the function `after_framework_start()` in the `boot_finished` file by adding the line in the end that starts `photoframe.sh`:

```
after_framework_start() {

    _t_fw=$(sed -e 's/ .*/000/ ; s/\.\(...\).*/\1/' < /proc/uptime )
    msg "time=$_t_fw:boot time after framework starts, in milliseconds" I "fwboot"

    # originally /usr/sbin/loginfo is in /etc/rcS.d/S20syslog-ng
    # but fail to run since dbus/lipc is not ready yet
    /usr/sbin/loginfo essentials --force

    # Make sure we're not in screensaver on system startup
    lipc-set-prop ${_POWERD_TARGET} ${_POWERD_WAKEUP_PROP} 1

    # Move setting the governor here
    /etc/init.d/ckimage start
    /etc/init.d/governor start
    ${TINYROT} --force

    sleep 1

    if [ -e /mnt/us/ENABLE_AUTOTEST ]; then
        if [ -e /test/unit_tests/stal/stal ]; then
            /test/unit_tests/stal/stal &
        fi
    fi

    # This is the line to be added to have photoframe starting automatically on boot.
    /mnt/us/photoframe/photoframe.sh &

    return 0
}
```

## 3D-printed frame

I modeled a frame for the Kindle, then 3D-printed and glued it.

It blends very well with the other "real" frames on my wall.
